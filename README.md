# Spam-Message-Detection
Spam message detection means finding out which messages are unwanted or fake, like ads or scams, and separating them from real messages. A computer looks at the words in the message, who sent it, and how it’s written to decide if it’s spam (bad) or not spam (good). This helps keep your inbox clean and safe.
